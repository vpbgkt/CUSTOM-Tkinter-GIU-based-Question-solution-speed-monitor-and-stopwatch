🔄 *Project Showcase: Stopwatch with SQLite Database using customtkinter* ⏱

The project combines Python, customtkinter for GUI, and SQLite for data storage. The main goal of this project is to help me monitor and improve my question-solving speed. Here's a quick overview:

1. *Stopwatch Functionality*:
   - Start, Pause, and Reset a stopwatch with a user-friendly interface.
   - Track and display elapsed time dynamically.

2. *Database Integration*:
   - Save your time records to an SQLite database.
   - Retrieve and calculate the average time taken for the last 7 entries.
   - Clear all stored data when needed.

3. *GUI Design*:
   - Utilized customtkinter for a modern and responsive interface.
   - Arranged control buttons in a single row for easy access.

🎯 *Tech Stack*:
- *Python*: Core logic and database handling.
- *customtkinter*: GUI design and management.
- *SQLite*: Lightweight and efficient data storage.

👨‍💻 *Learning Outcomes*:
- Combining GUI elements with database operations.
- Implementing stopwatch logic with pause and resume functionality.
- Presenting data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

This project is a great tool for anyone looking to track and improve their performance, whether for coding challenges or other timed tasks.
